What you want is to get rid of the map entry altogether. So you should check if it's the last element, and if it is, del that entry.

Also, he mentions changing to a set instead of an array because when he chose the array first, he was using the first index and then he probably thought ""wait.. now if I delete the first index I have to shift all the remaining ones to the left"". Well actually you can simply use the last one instead of the first by using ""pop"", and so you can still use the array",141,2024-11-07 23:18:40,0

@mattiapalmese2971,"i'm not really sure about that but inserting in a hashmap, will, at some point, result in a reallocation of the elements, since under the hood you store the elements inside an array indexed using a hash function. Usually you allocate more space when you have the array half full or 3/4. A data structure with an array that has a little buffer and gets reallocated when half full will get you the same time complexity, i suppose.
Also when deleting, yes, when you delete an element from the end of the array you don't need to push elements around to fill a void, but you still retain that memory. After some delete operations you would want to release that memory by realloc-ing everything in a smaller array and freeing the old memory.",1,2024-11-07 23:18:40,0

Asked good questions. Voiced thought process. Provided good test cases. Could recover from bugs. Could make use of hints.  Solved the assignment.

Not so good and red flags:
Too focused on how to ace the coding part instead of making a good impression as a team player. Some unnecessary code. 
Raised voice and tried to school the interviewer to cope with pressure. 
Didn't act humble and didn't seem very interested in reflection after the interview, instead was more interested in competition and returning a ""hard"" question.   
Also foul language and improvable attitude and composure. Might be just acceptable in a youtube interview but would have been much better without that!

 - says EXACTLY whats written... but thats ok, time to think in the problem. Hope its not just a script about interviews.
 - Good question
 - Great question
-- where are the other questions about the problem? So much things that he could have asked and that he wont know what to do when coding... as to what if getRandom is called with no inserts? 
 - WHAT? If you dont know why, you should not assume it is stupid... And saying that is VERY RUDE
 - The interviwer didnt even respond to that cause for real... that would be already enough for me to consider his attitude VERY negative. Even though it probably is very unconfortable for him, he should not blame the interviwer, he should just explain and try to find a better way together.
 - The right complexity, but a wrong think process, he was thinking that random.choice was O(n), and its explained right after when he is explained that its O(n) cause of the list transformation
 - What is he doing? hahahahahaha, Funny as f***. Such a contortionism to do something so simple. If the value is gonna be removed, why is he changing it to the last position hahahahaha, its gonna be removed, so it does not matter whats in the last position. But that is fine, I would not remove any points for that, but I would tell him to make that less confuse.
 - CREEPPYYYYY (nothing to remove points of course)
 - Please dont say that kind of thing, you don't know who's on the other side. He was rude about google docs and having OCD, wich is a real problem and that could be addressed during the interview normally. And now just swears like that... it could be a problem for the interviewer too and he didnt care, very impolite. 
 - Okay... he is not taking it seriouslly.
 - Thats the question... you can see now that the interviewer was very unconfortable with the way he was talking, and continued to be VERY POLITE. Congrats to the interviwer.


Well, the interviwer was amazing in handling the interview and giving his feedback. Even when saying about the bad points he was very polite.  I REALLY DONT THINK HE WOULD GIVE A HIRE TO HIM HAHAHAHAHAHA, and ROASTED him right after cause of his bad attitude.

Hard skills - Average (the question was very EASY, and the answer was a good one, after the allowing repeated numbers it was really a bad approach but the interviwer didnt want to complicate things for him)",2,2024-11-07 23:18:54,0

At the lightbulb moment timestamp, I'm not sure why you'd have to move the value to the end of the array to keep the constant time removal.

@krovvidisupraja6822,Thanks so much @NeetCode for doing this. I think this video is pretty realistic (except for the way @FryingPan talks 😂) compared to the other mock interview videos online! Helped me relate a lot being an interviewee. Looking forward to more such videos!! Keep inspiring with your good work 😃,102,2022-11-18T03:21:26Z,2

@LeSpaceCroissant,"My man was coding in Python and searched how to get the first element of a set in Java. Genius. And he said it so confidently too: ""I got it sir! I got it!"" 39:25 😂 
It's ""next(iter(mySet))"" by the way. 
And thank you for the video, it was really nice!",7,2024-05-21T20:33:23Z,0

Trouble is I cannot think aloud. I can think, then explain, but that takes more time. Hopefully not an issue, but we shall see 🤞",0,2024-04-29T16:49:09Z,0
